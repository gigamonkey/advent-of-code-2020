# advent-of-code-2020

[2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020), completed between 12/22 and 12/28. Wasn't going for maximum terseness the way I did in [2015](https://github.com/gigamonkey/advent-of-code-2015) when I did it in Haskell but I did better than in [2017](https://github.com/gigamonkey/advent-of-code-2017) when I apparently gave up after two days.

Hit a few stumbling blocks which you can probably see from my commit comments and from some [contemporaneous Tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apeterseibel%20%23AdventOfCode)
